  <img src="../photos/Chopped-Cheese.jpeg">
  <h2>These chopped cheese sliders are a slider version of the much-loved New York sandwich with ground beef, American cheese, shredded lettuce, and a special sauce on Hawaiian rolls.</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
    <li>Yellow mustard</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Smoked paprika</li>
    <li>Ground pepper</li>
    <li>Lean ground beef</li>
    <li>Sliced cheese</li>
    <li>Hawaiian sweet rolls</li>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Stir mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, garlic powder, and paprika together in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Drain excess fat, if desired.</li>
    <li>Lower heat to avoid overcooking beef, and lay cheese slices directly over beef. Allow to melt, about 3 minutes more, then chop beef and cheese together to create that signature chopped cheese texture.</li>
    <li>Slice Hawaiian rolls in half horizontally, keeping them attached. Spread chopped cheese sauce on both halves of rolls. Evenly distribute beef and cheese mixture over bottom half.</li>
    <li>Top with chopped lettuce, onion, and pickles. Place top buns back on and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
